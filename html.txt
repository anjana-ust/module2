Benefits of using External Files

Writing and Running first JavaScript Program
The script tags and type attribute are required to include JavaScript code in an HTML file.  Include script in body tag in html file run the program.
<html>
<head>
<title>hello</title>
<script type="text/javascript"> 
function callme() {
alert("hello world programming");
  }
</script>
</head>
<body>
<input type="button" name="b" value="Click"  onclick="callme()" />
</body>
</html>

<script type="text/javascript"> 
 /*Example statement here */    
  document.write('hello world');

</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>




3. Running JavaScript Program
1.Using Browser and Text Editor – Enter info in editor and save file as html and then launch in browser. To see the output, double click on file in folder to see output in browser.
<html><head>
<title>My First Javscript program</title>

<input type=“text” name=“tex”  id=“nam”  size=“30”  onMouseOver=“onmouse()” />
</body>
</html>



4. Running JavaScript Program
We can install IDE’s like webstorm, jsfiddle, sublimetext  etc and run javascript programs.
Follow these steps to run on webstorm
a). Install nodejs software
b) Install webstorm 11.0 and above from jetBrains
c) Choose workspace directory
d) Create new project
e) Choose javaScript option to create javascript file
f) Key in text shown below and save as first.js
   console.log(' Hello World'); 
g) Use run option and choose your program.
h) See Output on console:   Hello World



Local and Global Variables
There are two types of variables: local and global. 

Local variables 
Using the var keyword along with  the variable name is local because it cannot be accessed anywhere outside the scope where we declare it. 
Declaring statement using local variables
var num = 10;
document.write("The value of num is: "+ num);

Global variables 
Declaring the variable without the var keyword, it is accessible throughout the entire script, not only within that function. Which makes it global within script tag.
Declaring statement using global variables
Storing similar values in an array
var colors = new Array("orange", "blue", "red", "brown");
var colors = new Array(); 
colors[0] = "orange"; colors[1] = "blue"; colors[2] = "red"; colors[3] = "brown";
